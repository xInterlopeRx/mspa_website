Welcome to the official website of the MIdland Skatepark Association!

The association was founded in 2018 by Dustin Johnson, a Native of Midland Texas, a Navy veteran, father and avid skateboarder since the early 1990's.

In order to help maintain and possibly expand the Sam and William Honorary Skatepark Dustin founded the MSPA and began putting on small events and working with the City of Midland Parks and Recreation to make small modifications and repairs to the park, which was originally built in 2002.

Now 21 years old, the park is understandably beginning to show it's age. With good repair and maintenance the main and back bowls might last another ten years. During that time the MSPA will be working hard to create a brand known for social responsibility, athletic integrity, a healthy lifestyle with an emphasis on continuing education and entrepreneurial enterprise.

Now, after so long it's time the park and Association get a website. It might suck, but it's a start.
